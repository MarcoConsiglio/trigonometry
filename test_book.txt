A sum operation
 [x] can be performed with a SumBuilder.

An angle
 [x] has read-only properties "degrees", "minutes", "seconds", "direction".
 [x] can be created from separated values for degrees, minutes, seconds and direction.
 [x] can be created from a text representation.
 [x] can be created from a decimal number.
 [x] can be created from a radiant number.
 [x] can output degrees, minutes and seconds wrapped in a simple array.
 [x] can output degrees, minutes and seconds wrapped in an associative array.
 [x] can be printed in a positive textual representation.
 [x] can be printed in a negative textual representation.
 [x] can be casted to decimal.
 [x] can be casted to radiant.
 [x] can be clockwise or negative.
 [x] can be counterclockwise or positive.
 [x] can be reversed from clockwise to counterclockwise.
 [x] can be reversed from counterclockwise to clockwise.
 [x] can be equal or not to another angle.
 [x] can throw an exception if equal comparison has an unexpected type argument.
 [x] can be or not greater than another.
 [x] can throw an exception if greater than comparison has an unexpected type argument.
 [x] can be or not greater than or equal another angle.
 [x] can be or not less than another angle.
 [x] can throw an exception if less than comparison has an unexpected type argument.
 [x] can throw InvalidArgumentException.

The FromAngles builder
 [x] can sums two angles.
 [x] corrects positive excess if the sum is greater than 360°.
 [x] corrects negative excess if the sum is less than -360°.

The FromDecimal builder
 [x] can create a positive angle from a decimal value.
 [x] can create a negative angle from a decimal value.
 [x] cannot create an angle with more than +/-360°.
 [x] can create an angle of exact 360°.

The FromDegrees builder
 [x] can create an angle from a degrees values.
 [x] cannot build an angle with more than 360°.
 [x] cannot build an angle with more than 59'.
 [x] cannot build an angle with 60" or more.
 [x] can create an angle of exact 360°.

The FromRadiant builder
 [x] can create a positive angle from a radiant value.
 [x] can create a negative angle from a radiant value.
 [x] cannot create an angle with more than +/-360°.
 [x] can create an angle of exact 360°.

The FromString builder
 [x] can create a positive angle from a string value.
 [x] can create a negative angle from a string value.
 [x] cannot create an angle with more than 360°.
 [x] cannot create an angle with more than 59'.
 [x] cannot create an angle with more than 60".

The RegExFailureException
 [x] is thrown when the regular expression fails to match the input.
